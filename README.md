# Details 

One of the most important problem in the localization and mapping of camera-based autonomous driving vehicles is the technology to automatically detect and classify road lanes and symbolic road marking (SRM) on the road. To implement this problem through learning using machine learning, a large
amount of data is required. In particular, pixel-level annotated dataset is required for semantic road model mapping. The dataset where lanes and SRMs are pixel level annotated has
recently been open, but existing datasets do not contain GPS or odometry of vehicle which are required for mapping or have limited trajectories.
